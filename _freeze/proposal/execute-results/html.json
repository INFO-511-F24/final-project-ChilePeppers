The three datasets considered for the project were (i) electric vehicle (EV) Charging, (ii) an analysis of Spotify Data, and (iii) an assessment of Mobile User Data. The reason and justification for why the team would like to work with these three datasets is provided herein. The team has agreed to select the EV Charging Dataset for the project out of an interest to explore that evolving technical space and build predictive models for charging efficiency.\"\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-tools: true\n    code-overflow: wrap\n    code-line-numbers: true\n    embed-resources: true\neditor: visual\ncode-annotations: hover\nexecute:\n  warning: false\njupyter: python3\n---\n\n::: {#load-pkgs .cell message='false' execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport warnings\nimport pandas as pd\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Introduction to the Data\n\n::: {#load-dataset .cell message='false' execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nurl = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INFO-511-F24/final-project-ChilePeppers/main/data/ev_charging_patterns.csv\"\nev_charging  = pd.read_csv(url)\n\nurl = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INFO-511-F24/final-project-ChilePeppers/main/data/Spotify_Most_Streamed_Songs.csv\"\n\nSpotify_db = pd.read_csv(url)\n\nurl = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INFO-511-F24/final-project-ChilePeppers/main/data/Mobile_user_behavior_dataset.csv\"\n\ndata = pd.read_csv(url)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Dataset 1 - Electric Vehicle Charging\n\n-   Source of Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/electric-vehicle-charging-patterns\n\n-   Description of Observations: This dataset provides a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicle (EV) charging patterns and user behavior. It contains 1,320 samples of charging session data, including metrics such as energy consumption, charging duration, and vehicle details. Each entry captures various aspects of EV usage, allowing for insightful analysis and predictive modeling.\n\n-   Ethical Concerns: The dataset has user IDs and specific charging station locations, which means there’s a chance it could reveal patterns in people’s movements and behaviors. To protect privacy, it’s important to keep user IDs anonymous and possibly generalize location data so individuals can’t be tracked. Researchers also need to handle this information carefully and follow data protection rules to use it responsibly.\n\n-   Question:\n\n    1.  How do vehicle model, user type, and starting state of charge influence the cost and duration of EV charging sessions at public stations?\n    2.  Exploring energy consumption and charging behaviors\n    3.  Building predictive models for charging efficiency\n\n-   Importance:Understanding the costs and durations associated with different EV types and user profiles can help:\n\n    -   Consumers make cost-effective charging decisions.\n    -   Charging service providers optimize station usage and pricing strategies by identifying patterns in energy demand and time usage.\n\n-   Hypothesis:\n\n    -   Vehicle Model: Larger battery capacity models will have longer charging times and higher costs.\n    -   User Type: Frequent users (like commuters) may incur lower costs per session due to shorter, more regular charging patterns.\n    -   Starting State of Charge: Lower starting charge levels are expected to lead to longer and more costly charging sessions.\n\n-   Variable Types: Categorical Variables: Vehicle Model, User Type Quantitative Variables: Charging Cost (USD), Charging Duration (hours), State of Charge (Start %)\n\n## Glimpse of the Data: Dataset 1 - EV

charging dataset comprises 20 columns, 10 object variables and 10 float64 variables. The analysis plan will be completed in three steps to answer the questions and hypothesis stated above. \n\nStep 1: A graphical analysis of the dataset \n\nStep 2: A statistical analysis of the dataset using (i) analysis of variance and (ii) mullivariable regression to understand patterns within the data.\n\nStep 3: Build a predictive model from the data to understand and predict trends. \n\n## Dataset 2 - Spotify User Data \n\n* Source of the Data:\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdulszz/spotify-most-streamed-songs\nThis dataset originates from Apple's and Spotify's public API. Each track’s streaming metrics and musical attributes could have been aggregated from streaming services' API or charts, though specific documentation would be necessary to confirm.\n\n* Description of Observations:\nObservations include details on each song’s title, artist(s), release date, and musical attributes (e.g., tempo, key, mode, acousticness, danceability). There are also metrics related to streaming, such as chart ranks and playlist placements on various platforms.\n\n* Ethical Concerns:\nThe primary ethical concern is the potential for data bias. Since popular songs are more likely to be Western or English-language songs, this could lead to cultural or genre bias in the analysis. Furthermore, if the data includes rankings or metrics derived from proprietary algorithms, care should be taken to avoid misuse or misinterpretation of these rankings.\n\n* Question: \nHow do musical attributes (such as tempo, energy, and valence) affect a song’s popularity on Spotify as measured by the number of streams and inclusion in playlists?\n\n* Importance: \nUnderstanding the relationship between musical attributes and popularity can be valuable for artists, producers, and streaming platforms to optimize song characteristics for a wider audience reach.\n\n* Hypothesis: \nHigher energy and danceability correlate with higher popularity metrics, as listeners may prefer upbeat and energetic tracks.\n\n* Variable Types:\nCategorical: Key, mode, release date\nQuantitative: Streams, danceability, valence, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness\n\n\n## Glimpse of the Data: Dataset 2: Spotify Dataset\n\n::: {#5ecc5ef8 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(f'\\n\\nTable 3: Spotify Dataset - Column Summary:\\n\\n')\nSpotify_db.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\nTable 3: Spotify Dataset - Column Summary:\n\n\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=10}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>track_name</th>\n      <th>artist(s)_name</th>\n      <th>artist_count</th>\n      <th>released_year</th>\n      <th>released_month</th>\n      <th>released_day</th>\n      <th>in_spotify_playlists</th>\n      <th>in_spotify_charts</th>\n      <th>streams</th>\n      <th>in_apple_playlists</th>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <th>key</th>\n      <th>mode</th>\n      <th>danceability_%</th>\n      <th>valence_%</th>\n      <th>energy_%</th>\n      <th>acousticness_%</th>\n      <th>instrumentalness_%</th>\n      <th>liveness_%</th>\n      <th>speechiness_%</th>\n      <th>cover_url</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Seven (feat.

When writing a research question, please think about the following:\n\n-   What is your target population?\n\n-   Is the question original?\n\n-   Can the question be answered?\n\nFor each data set, include the following:\n\n-   A well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.)\n\n-   Statement on why this question is important.\n\n-   A description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\n-   Identify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\n## Glimpse of data\n\nFor each data set:\n\n-   Place the file containing your data in the data folder of the project repo.\n\n-   Use the `.head()` and `.info()` functions to provide a glimpse of the data set.\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n\n",
