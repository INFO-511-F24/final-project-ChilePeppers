    "text": "Dataset 1 - Electric Vehicle Charging\n\nSource of Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/electric-vehicle-charging-patterns\nDescription of Observations: This dataset provides a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicle (EV) charging patterns and user behavior. It contains 1,320 samples of charging session data, including metrics such as energy consumption, charging duration, and vehicle details. Each entry captures various aspects of EV usage, allowing for insightful analysis and predictive modeling.\nEthical Concerns: The dataset has user IDs and specific charging station locations, which means there’s a chance it could reveal patterns in people’s movements and behaviors. To protect privacy, it’s important to keep user IDs anonymous and possibly generalize location data so individuals can’t be tracked. Researchers also need to handle this information carefully and follow data protection rules to use it responsibly.\nQuestion:\n\nHow do vehicle model, user type, and starting state of charge influence the cost and duration of EV charging sessions at public stations?\nExploring energy consumption and charging behaviors\nBuilding predictive models for charging efficiency\n\nImportance:Understanding the costs and durations associated with different EV types and user profiles can help:\n\nConsumers make cost-effective charging decisions.\nCharging service providers optimize station usage and pricing strategies by identifying patterns in energy demand and time usage.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nVehicle Model: Larger battery capacity models will have longer charging times and higher costs.\nUser Type: Frequent users (like commuters) may incur lower costs per session due to shorter, more regular charging patterns.\nStarting State of Charge: Lower starting charge levels are expected to lead to longer and more costly charging sessions.\n\nVariable Types: Categorical Variables: Vehicle Model, User Type Quantitative Variables: Charging Cost (USD), Charging Duration (hours), State of Charge (Start %)"
