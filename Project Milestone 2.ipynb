    "* Description of Observations:\n",
    "Observations include details on each song’s title, artist(s), release date, and musical attributes (e.g., tempo, key, mode, acousticness, danceability). There are also metrics related to streaming, such as chart ranks and playlist placements on various platforms.\n",

    "* Ethical Concerns:\n",
    "The primary ethical concern is the potential for data bias. Since popular songs are more likely to be Western or English-language songs, this could lead to cultural or genre bias in the analysis. Furthermore, if the data includes rankings or metrics derived from proprietary algorithms, care should be taken to avoid misuse or misinterpretation of these rankings."
